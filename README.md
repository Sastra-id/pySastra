# Design Plan

| Planned | Pipeline         | Description               |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ğŸŸ  | Language         | A text-processing pipeline. |
| ğŸŸ¡ | Tokenizer        | Segment text, and createÂ DocÂ objects with the discovered segment boundaries.|
| ğŸŸ  | Lemmatizer       | Determine the base forms of words.|
| ğŸŸ¡ | Morphology       | Assign linguistic features like lemmas, noun case, verb tense etc. based on the word and its part-of-speech tag.|
| ğŸŸ  | Tagger           | Annotate part-of-speech tags onÂ DocÂ objects.|
| ğŸ”„ | DependencyParser | Annotate syntactic dependencies onÂ DocÂ objects.|
| ğŸ”„ | EntityRecognizer | Annotate named entities, e.g. persons or products, onÂ DocÂ objects.|
| ğŸ”„ | TextCategorizer  | Assign categories or labels toÂ DocÂ objects.|
| ğŸ”„ | Matcher          | Match sequences of tokens, based on pattern rules, similar to regular expressions.|
| ğŸ”„ | PhraseMatcher    | Match sequences of tokens based on phrases.|
| ğŸ”„ | EntityRuler      | Add entity spans to theÂ DocÂ using token-based rules or exact phrase matches.|
| ğŸ”„ | Sentencizer      | Implement custom sentence boundary detection logic that doesnâ€™t require the dependency parse.|
